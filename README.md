# Answering Business Questions using SQL

For this project we'll use the Chinook database provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db.

The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. There is information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases.
